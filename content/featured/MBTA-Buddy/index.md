An Android mobile application that provides users with up to date train arrival/departure predictions at stops along Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) lines. The application allows users to navigate between different lines and stops with simple swipe gestures. Tapping a stop lists upcoming arrival/departure times for trains and their direction of travel.
